# Proj Dev Todo
The app allows the user to add and track their tasks.

## Requirements
The latest Node.js version should be installed on your machine

## Instructions
Run the following commands
```bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# run the app
npm start
```
This should automatically open the app page on your browser, but you can manually access by following the link provided by the `npm start` command, usually `http://localhost:3000`.
